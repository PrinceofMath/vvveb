Bootstrap scrollspy needs a patch to work with links containing the url of the page

this

const queries = SELECTOR_LINK_ITEMS.split(',').map(selector => `${selector}[data-bs-target="${target}"],${selector}[href="${target}"]`);

needs to be changed to

const queries = SELECTOR_LINK_ITEMS.split(',').map(selector => `${selector}[data-bs-target="${target}"],${selector}[href*="${target}"]`);
